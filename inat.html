    <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on March 20 cleared a $3 billion-Extended Fund Facility (EFF) 
        for Sri Lanka, potentially unlocking more loans for the debt-ridden island nation that is struggling
         to recover from last years economic meltdown.
         Identifying corruption as a key issue, an IMF “governance diagnostic mission” has started assessing 
         Sri Lanka governance and anti-corruption framework in its first such exercise in Asia.

        <p>The courtyards of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra have been busy with more than just the usual worshippers, 
        going to and from its churches in the sprawling monastic complex that is Ukraine’s most revered Orthodox 
        site.

Also busy Friday were people in civilian clothes, loading cars with plasma televisions, furniture and other 
items from the buildings — helping the resident monks remove belongings of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, or UOC, 
before a threatened government eviction on March 29.</p>
