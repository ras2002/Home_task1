    <p>Sergio Perez held off team-mate Max Verstappen to take a Red Bull one-two in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

        Verstappen fought up from 15th on the grid to fourth place before a safety car closed up the field and 
        brought him into contention for victory.
        
        But after passing Mercedes' George Russell and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, Verstappen could not 
        catch Perez and had to settle for second.

            Former Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has heaped praise on Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk,
             saying he is one of the best centre-backs in the world and seems like a big character in the 
             dressing room.

Speaking to Liverpool Echo, Cahill said Van Dijk is a massive player for Liverpool and is one of the best 
defenders in world football. Van Dijk was part of the Dutch squad that succumbed a humiliating 4-0 defeat at 
the hands of France earlier this week.
